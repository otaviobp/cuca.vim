# cuca.vim

Cuca is vim based notebook consisted of linked notes, inspired on the concept Zettelkasten and Wikis.

This project is still under development, with a lot of bugs and should be used with at your own risk.

I struggled for some time to find a good software to organize and keep all my personal notes and notes I make when I'm studying a topic. Inspired by the concept of Zettelkasten and Wikis, I decided to create a vim plugin and a cli command to manage a notebook with the following concepts in mind:

 - All notes are saved on same directory and on plain text, formatted using Markdown, so common linux cmdline tools (grep, find, etc) can be used to locate content.
 - Notes have links between them on a format similar to a wiki markdowns (link surrounded by [])
 - All editing should be done on vim, but visualization can be performed in external tools, like generating htmls to view notes on a browser
 - Using the CLI should be optional, i.e., all commands available on the CLI should have an equivalent on the vim plugin.
